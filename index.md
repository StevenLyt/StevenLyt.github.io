I'm a Software Engineer at DoorDash. I graduated from University of Southern California double majoring in computer science and mathematics. I was a research assistant at IDM Lab doing research on Multi-Agent Path Finding. I’m the creator of [mapf-visualizer.com](http://mapf-visualizer.com/). I'm also broadly interested in software engineering and full stack development. Outside of work, I’m a huge fan of algorithms and theoretical computer science.
