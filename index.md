I'm a senior student majoring in computer science and mathematics at the University of Southern California. I was a research assistant at IDM Lab doing research on Multi-Agent Path Finding. I'm also broadly interested in software engineering and interned at Amazon's [Buy With Prime](https://buywithprime.amazon.com/) team. I'm also very interested in algorithms and theory of computation.
